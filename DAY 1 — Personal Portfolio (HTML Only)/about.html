    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    I am a first-year college student with a strong interest in coding, problem-solving, 
    and continuous self-improvement. I enjoy learning new technologies, building small projects, 
    and improving my logical thinking through practice. I have also participated in Codeutsava, 
    which helped me gain exposure to collaborative coding and real-world problem solving.
